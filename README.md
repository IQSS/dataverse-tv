## Development

If you want to test your changes locally, you need to visit `index.html` using a webserver.
Otherwise, the JavaScript will not be executed. Simplest way is using `python3 -m http.server`
in a terminal at the root of the cloned code repository, then open http://localhost:8000 in a browser.

If you want to preview the embedded variant, go to http://localhost:8000/iframe.html.
